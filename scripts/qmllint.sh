# promotes to error level). Every analyzer warning category is disabled so the
# large legacy QML inherited from upstream latte-dock does not drown the log,
# and unresolved org.kde.* imports (Plasma modules are not installed in the
# CI container) cannot affect the result. Exit code 255 on a syntax error is
# exactly the regression class this gate exists to catch.
#
# Usage: scripts/qmllint.sh [file.qml ...]
#        With no arguments, all git-tracked *.qml files are linted.
